Dr Fotis E. Psomopoulos works as a Principal Investigator at the Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB) of the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH), with a primary focus on bioinformatics workflows and computational analysis of large bio-datasets. He has received his doctorate and engineering diploma from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH), in 2010 and 2004 respectively. In 2014 he has been awarded with a post-doctoral fellowship scholarship by the AUTh Research Committee. He has worked as a teaching assistant and academic fellow at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, as a Visiting Professor at Quest University (Vancouver, Canada) and as an Adjunct Lecturer at the University of Western Macedonia.

His research interests are mainly focused on Bioinformatics (NGS data analyses and Data Integration), Data Mining techniques for knowledge extraction form large bio-datasets and Parallel and Distributed Computing (such as Cloud Computing) among others. In this context, he has been selected as an EGI Champion on Bioinformatics in 2013 and as an RDA Ambassador in 2019. Finally, he has organized several national and international training activities on NGS Data Analysis and Cloud Computing, as well as Software and Data Carpentry workshops, and has been elected as the deputy Training Coordinator of ELIXIR-GR in 2018. Additionally, as of January 2020 he is a member of the ELIXIR Training Platform Executive Committee, and he is co-leading two ELIXIR tasks (Training Platform Task 2 "Gap analysis, training materials development and training delivery" and Tools Platform Task 4 "Software Best Practices").
