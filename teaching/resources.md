As part of the [CODATA-RDA Research Data Science Summer School](http://www.codata.org/datatrieste2018) in Trieste (6-17 Aug 2018), ELIXIR Training has contributed in the organization of the flanking Advanced Bioinformatics workshop (20-24 Aug 2018) with a particular focus on Machine Learning applications, as part of the ELIXIR Implementation Study on Learning Paths.

This advanced bioinformatics course provided an overview of the current status of different NGS workflows (variant calling, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Metagenomics etc), and combined them with the appropriate Machine Learning and Data Mining approaches. After providing a strong foundation of the underlying theory and concepts, the course relied heavily on hand-on exercises and tutorials in order for the participants to directly apply and practice on methods and techniques presented throughout each day.

The course was led by me (INAB|CERTH, ELIXIR Greece), with [Amel Ghouila](https://github.com/amelgh) (Institut Pasteur de Tunis / H3ABionet) and [Gabriele Schweikert](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gschweik/) (Cyber Valley Initiative, University of TÃ¼bingen, DE / Computational Biology, University of Dundee, UK) as co-instructors of the course. Moreover, the daily training activities were supported by three helpers; Maria Tsagiopoulou (INAB|CERTH), Ola Karrar (University of Khartoum) and a past learner to the CODATA-RDA Research Data Science Summer School, and David Helekal (University of Dundee).

## Workshop on Reproducible analysis and Research Transparency

This workshop was part of the [Open Science Tools, Data & Technologies for Efficient Ecological & Evolutionary Research](https://nioo.knaw.nl/en/open-science-tools) Symposium, organized by NIOO-KNAW and DANS-KNAW on 7 & 8 December 2017 at the [Amsterdam Science Park](https://www.amsterdamsciencepark.nl/about-amsterdam-science-park/profile/).

This workshop provided an overview of the to date status in reproducible analysis in order to provide transparency in research. The workshop covered methodological topics (such as the use of the Open Science Framework and reporting guidelines) as well as software tools (such as `Git`, `Docker`, `RMarkdown` / `knitr` and `Jupyter`). Going beyond simple listing and presentations, the workshop focused on hands-on skill building, with exercises and tutorials covering most of the software aspects.
