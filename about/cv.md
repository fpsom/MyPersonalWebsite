I graduated from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece in 2004 (with 9th degree ranking) and obtained my Ph.D. from the same Department in 2010 under the supervision of Prof. Pericles Mitkas. I trained in the design and development of parallel and distributed data mining algorithms, with a particular focus on bioinformatics, investigating data mining techniques for knowledge extraction from genomic data. In my transition towards bioinformatics, I benefited greatly from spending time in Prof. Christos Ouzounis' Lab at King's College London, under whose supervision I worked later on as part of my post-doctoral research.

Between 2010 andÂ 2014 I worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of Applied Biosciences under the supervision of Prof. Christos Ouzounis, in the context of the EU Research Programme "MICROME: A Knowledge-Based Bioinformatics Framework for Microbial Pathway Genomics". Main goal of the work at this period was to support the large scale inference of metabolic flux directly from genome sequence.

In 2014 I was awarded with a post-doctoral fellowship scholarship by the AUTh Research Committee. Since then I have worked as a teaching assistant and academic fellow at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, as a Visiting Professor at Quest University (Vancouver, Canada) and as an Adjunct Lecturer at the University of Western Macedonia. Moreover, I have participated as a researcher and project manager in several European (RAPP, ASSIST) and national research projects.

My research focus lies across three major pillars; (a) Bioinformatics and in particular data integration approaches for multiple NGS technologies, (b) data mining methods and techniques in order to analyse the vast amount of data involved, and (c) Grid and Cloud Computing in order to ensure the necessary computational power and to optimize automated bioinformatics workflows for large-scale approaches. In this context, I have been selected to be an EGI Champion on Bioinformatics in 2013, and in 2019 as an RDA-EU Ambassador on Bioinformatics.

Finally, given my extensive training activities, both at the national and the European level, I am a member of the ELIXIR Training Platform Executive Committee, a member of the EOSC Skills and Training Working Group, and the deputy Training Coordinator for ELIXIR-GR.
