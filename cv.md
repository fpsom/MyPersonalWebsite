I graduated from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece in 2004 (with 9th degree ranking) and obtained my Ph.D. from the same Department in 2010 under the supervision of Prof. Pericles Mitkas. I trained in the design and development of parallel and distributed data mining algorithms, with a particular focus on bioinformatics, investigating data mining techniques for knowledge extraction from genomic data. In my transition towards bioinformatics, I benefited greatly from spending time in Prof. Christos Ouzounis' Lab at King's College London, under whose supervision I worked later on as part of my post-doctoral research.


Between 2010 andÂ 2014 I worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of Applied Biosciences under the supervision of Prof. Christos Ouzounis, in the context of the EU Research Programme "MICROME: A Knowledge-Based Bioinformatics Framework for Microbial Pathway Genomics". Main goal of the work at this period was to support the large scale inference of metabolic flux directly from genome sequence.

My research interests lay across three major pillars; (a) Bioinformatics and the evolutionary analysis of genomes based on their protein data, (b) data mining methods and techniques in order to analyse the vast amount of data involved, and (c) Grid and Cloud Computing in order to ensure the necessary computational power and to optimize the developed methods for large-scale approaches. A quick overview of my research can be seen through the word cloud produced by the titles and abstracts of my articles to date.
