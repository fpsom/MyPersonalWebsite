Working with friends, beyond being a pleasure, usually bears fruit. Case in study, the article published today on the [EGI Inspire Newsletter](https://www.egi.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Inspired-issue-14.pdf)Â with the help of close friend and colleague [Afonso Duarte](https://sites.google.com/site/afonsomduarte/).

Beyond being a nice study on the trend of Life Sciences working with e-infrastructures (and Grid/Cloud computing specifically), this article is also an announcement of the Workshop we are organizing in the upcoming EGI Conference in Helsinki. Hope to see you there too! ;)
