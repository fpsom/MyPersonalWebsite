Well, I will definitely remember September 2016 for a number of reasons, but one is definitely the amount of travel involved. The story will be much easier if I break this down to numbers:

{% include image.html url="/images/Sea-Sky.jpg" caption="Morning view, between sea and sky" width=400 align="right" %}

- **Nights away from home**: 17
- **Total Distance traveled**: 31,444 km (_fyi, this 78% of the circumference of the earth_)
  - By airplane: 30,711 km in 15 flights
  - By car: 448 km
  - On foot: 193 km (_curtesy of my tracker_)
  - By train: 92 km
- **Locations**
  - 5 Cities: The Hague, Denver, Warsaw, Krakow, Trikala
  - 8 Airport Codes: SKG, ATH, AMS, MUC, DEN, WAW, VIE, KRK
  - 3 Countries: The Netherlands, USA, Poland
  - 2 Continents: Europe, America

All in all, a very active month (but I'd rather not do so many trips in that short of a time). :)
