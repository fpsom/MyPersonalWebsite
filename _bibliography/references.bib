@phdthesis{FpsomPhDThesis,
	abstract = {Although Bioinformatics and Computational Biology are often confused as the same multidisciplinary field, there exist several differences that distinguish them. Bioinformatics focuses on analysis and processing of biological data and consequently the promotion of research in algorithms and technical level of both the methods and theory to solve formal problems of data management. On the other hand, Computational Biology aims to solve specific problems in Biology, utilizing the potential of computers for testing and evaluating hypothesis. Nevertheless the two fields share several areas of convergence. Proteomics is one of these areas and is also the focus of extensive ongoing research. Proteomics is essentially the large-scale study of proteins, ranging from the identification and analysis of their structure to the prediction of their functionality and the construction of metabolic pathways. In recent years there has been a shift in research interest in Bioinformatics from genomics to proteomics, which is widely considered as the next step in the study of biological systems. While the genome of an organization remains fairly constant in different cells of the same organization, the proteome of a species is highly differentiated from cell to cell. In previous years, genomics and proteomics could only focus on one gene or protein at a time. However, the technological advancements in Life Sciences has led to an exponentially growing amount of data. For this reason there has been a shift in research, from hypothesis-driven to data-driven studies. As the demand for automated analysis of large and distributed data grows, new challenges emerge both regarding the modeling and the development of algorithms for high throughput data analysis. This thesis presents a general methodology for Bioinformatics Algorithm Development in Grid Environments (BADGE) aiming at precisely these challenges. Grid Computing can be viewed as a virtual computing architecture that provides the ability to perform higher throughput processing by taking advantage of many computers geographically dispersed and connected by a network. Bioinformatics applications can benefit greatly from the increased availability, reliability and efficiency of computational resources, in such a distributed environment. There is already considerable research in progress toward applying parallel computing techniques on bioinformatics methods, such as multiple sequence alignment, gene expression analysis and phylogenetic studies. In order to cope with the dimensionality issue, most machine learning methods focus on specific groups of proteins or reduce either the size of the original data set or the number of attributes involved. Grid Computing can potentially provide an alternative solution to this problem, by combining multiple approaches in a seamless way. The BADGE methodology presented in this thesis, couples the strengths of the Grid with the specific needs and constraints of proven bioinformatics approaches. In order to evaluate the BADGE methodology, we applied it on several existing algorithms and on a series of new algorithms, which were developed to address issues both in Bioinformatics and in other research areas as well. The bioinformatics algorithms we designed mainly focus on proteomics and aim to provide solution to the problems of protein classification, prediction of protein function, and abnormal gene detection. Finally, the methodology was also used in the development of an algorithm in Computational Chemistry, addressing the problem of identifying molecular knots in three dimensional space. In every case, it was shown, both theoretically and experimentally, that the new approach presents clear advantages over conventional approaches in terms of time performance and robustness.},

@phdthesis{FpsomMasterThesis,
	abstract = {An important challenge in modern functional proteomics is the prediction of the functional behavior of proteins. Motifs in protein chains can make such a prediction possible. The correlation between protein properties and their motifs is not always obvious, since more than one motifs can exist within a protein chain. Thus, the behavior of a protein is a function of many motifs, where some overpower others. In this paper a data-mining approach for motif-based classification of proteins is presented. A new classification rules inducing algorithm that exploits finite state automata is introduced. First, data are modeled by terms of prefix tree acceptors, which are later merged into finite state automata. Finally, we propose a new algorithm for the induction of protein classification rules from finite state automata. The data-mining model is trained and tested using various protein and protein class subsets, as well as the whole dataset of known proteins and protein classes. Results indicate the efficiency of our technique compared to other known data-mining algorithms.},

Although extensive genomic resources are available at present for tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), melon (Cucumis melo) and watermelon (Citrullus lanatus), genomic databases for Cucurbita species are limited. Recently, our group reported the generation of pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) transcriptome databases from two contrasting cultivars with extreme fruit sizes. In the current study we used these databases to perform comparative transcriptome analysis in order to identify genes with potential roles in fruit morphology and fruit size. Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis between cv. ‘Munchkin’ (small-fruit) and cv. ‘Big Moose’ (large-fruit) revealed a variety of candidate genes associated with fruit morphology with significant differences in gene expression between the two cultivars. In addition, we have set the framework for generating EST-SSR markers, which discriminate different C. pepo cultivars and show transferability to related Cucurbitaceae species. The results of the present study will contribute to both further understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating fruit morphology and furthermore identifying the factors that determine fruit size. Moreover, they may lead to the development of molecular marker tools for selecting genotypes with desired morphological traits.}

As the on-board robot computational resources are limited, but in some cases the demands imposed on the robot by the user are virtually limitless, the solution is to produce a variable structure system. The task dependent part has to be exchanged, however the task governs the activities of the robot. Thus not only exchange of some task-dependent modules is required, but also supervisory responsibilities have to be switched. Such control systems are necessary in the case of robot companions, where the owner of the robot may demand from it to provide many services.}

	abstract = {Phylogenetic profiles express the presence or absence of genes and their homologs across a number of reference genomes. They have emerged as an elegant representation framework for comparative genomics and have been used for the genome-wide inference and discovery of functionally linked genes or metabolic pathways. As the number of reference genomes grows, there is an acute need for faster and more accurate methods for phylogenetic profile analysis with increased performance in speed and quality. We propose a novel, efficient method for the detection of genomic idiosyncrasies, i.e. sets of genes found in a specific genome with peculiar phylogenetic properties, such as intra-genome correlations or inter-genome relationships. Our algorithm is a four-step process where genome profiles are first defined as fuzzy vectors, then discretized to binary vectors, followed by a de-noising step, and finally a comparison step to generate intra- and inter-genome distances for each gene profile. The method is validated with a carefully selected benchmark set of five reference genomes, using a range of approaches regarding similarity metrics and pre-processing stages for noise reduction. We demonstrate that the fuzzy profile method consistently identifies the actual phylogenetic relationship and origin of the genes under consideration for the majority of the cases, while the detected outliers are found to be particular genes with peculiar phylogenetic patterns. The proposed method provides a time-efficient and highly scalable approach for phylogenetic stratification, with the detected groups of genes being either similar to their own genome profile or different from it, thus revealing atypical evolutionary histories.},

	abstract = {The entire publicly available set of 37 genome sequences from the bacterial order Chlamydiales has been subjected to comparative analysis in order to reveal the salient features of this pangenome and its evolutionary history. Over 2,000 protein families are detected across multiple species, with a distribution consistent to other studied pangenomes. Of these, there are 180 protein families with multiple members, 312 families with exactly 37 members corresponding to core genes, 428 families with peripheral genes with varying taxonomic distribution and finally 1,125 smaller families. The fact that, even for smaller genomes of Chlamydiales, core genes represent over a quarter of the average protein complement, signifies a certain degree of structural stability, given the wide range of phylogenetic relationships within the group. In addition, the propagation of a corpus of manually curated annotations within the discovered core families reveals key functional properties, reflecting a coherent repertoire of cellular capabilities for Chlamydiales. We further investigate over 2,000 genes without homologs in the pangenome and discover two new protein sequence domains. Our results, supported by the genome-based phylogeny for this group, are fully consistent with previous analyses and current knowledge, and point to future research directions towards a better understanding of the structural and functional properties of Chlamydiales.},

Most computational approaches are based on the similarity between sequences to infer gene function. However, the availability of several fully sequenced genomes has enabled alternative approaches, such as phylogenetic profiles. Phylogenetic profiles are vectors which indicate the presence or absence of a gene in other genomes. The main concept of phylogenetic profiles is that proteins participating in a common structural complex or metabolic pathway are likely to evolve in a correlated fashion. In this paper, a multi-level clustering algorithm of phylogenetic profiles is presented, which aims to detect inter- and intra-genome gene clusters.},

	abstract = {A Grid environment can be viewed as a virtual computing architecture that provides the ability to perform higher throughput computing by taking advantage of many computers geographically dispersed and connected by a network. Bioinformatics applications stand to gain in such a distributed environment in terms of increased availability, reliability and efficiency of computational resources. There is already considerable research in progress toward applying parallel computing techniques on bioinformatics methods, such as multiple sequence alignment, gene expression analysis and phylogenetic studies. In order to cope with the dimensionality issue, most machine learning methods either focus on specific groups of proteins or reduce the size of the original data set and/or the number of attributes involved. Grid computing could potentially provide an alternative solution to this problem, by combining multiple approaches in a seamless way. In this paper we introduce a unifying methodology coupling the strengths of the Grid with the specific needs and constraints of the major bioinformatics approaches. We also present a tool that implements this process and allows researchers to assess the computational needs for a specific task and optimize the allocation of available resources for its efficient completion.},

	abstract = {In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the existence of subsets of patients with stereotyped B cell receptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG), collectively accounting for ~30\% of all CLL, strongly implicates antigen selection in disease ontogeny. That said, it is still inconclusive if and how frequently "CLL-specific" BcR IG gene rearrangements occur in the repertoire of unaffected individuals. This is especially relevant when also considering monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), detected in 3-12\% of the general population and characterized by the presence of CLL-like clonal B cells in lower numbers compared to CLL with no evidence of disease. MBL is distinguished into high and low count (HC-MBL and LC-MBL, respectively) with the former considered as a pre-leukemic condition, while the latter having an unclear, if any, link to CLL. Our previous immunogenetic studies have revealed similarities between HC-MBL and CLL, thus setting them apart from LC-MBL that displayed distinct IG gene usage and low incidence of stereotypy. However, these studies were Sanger-based, thus inherently limited regarding sensitivity and accurate quantification.Here we sought to overcome these limitations and obtain a comprehensive view into the composition of the IG repertoire in LC-MBL by NGS immunoprofiling, searching particularly for major CLL IG stereotypes. The study group comprised 23 individuals with CLL-like (CD5+) LC-MBL identified by a standardized flow cytometry protocol. PBMCs were the starting material in 11 cases, whereas sorted MBL cells were studied in the remaining 12 cases; in 9 cases, the normal B cell compartment was also flow sorted. Included in the analysis were also 6 individuals without LC-MBL in whom we sorted different B cell subpopulations, including na{\"\i}ve B cells (n=6) and memory B cells (n=5). IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ gene rearrangements were RT-PCR amplified with leader primers and sequencing libraries were prepared with the TruSeq DNA LT Kit and run on the MiSeq Sequencer using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3. NGS reads were subjected to an in-house bioinformatics pipeline for clonotype characterization and the identification of CLL-specific BcR IG stereotypes.Overall, 16,857,788 productive filtered-in sequence reads were obtained corresponding to an average of 366,474 reads/sample (range: 67,175-662,994). We identified very few reads (2,470/16,857,788; 0.15\%) corresponding to 17/19 major CLL BcR IG stereotypes. Their incidence in LC-MBL did not follow the CLL trend: for instance, the stereotypic IGHV3-21 gene rearrangement defining subset $\#$2, the most frequent in CLL, accounted for only 27/2,470 reads (1.1\%) corresponding to major subset stereotypes. Overall, stereotypes were identified in 26/47 samples (55\%) from 13/23 LC-MBL and 6/6 non LC-MBL cases. In LC-MBL cases bearing stereotypes the breakdown according to sample type was as follows: (i) PBMCs, n=3 (ii) normal B cell compartment, n=7; (iii) sorted MBL cells, n=5: the stereotypes detected in this particular sample type were present at very low frequencies and concerned rearrangements with unmutated IGHV genes. In individuals without LC-MBL, stereotypes were detected in all 6 samples from na{\"\i}ve B cells versus only 2/5 samples from memory B cells. In general, we did not identify significant associations between specific B cell subpopulations and particular stereotypes, except for the IGHV4-34 rearrangement defining CLL subset $\#$4, an indolent CLL variant with features of BcR-anergized clones, which was found only within na{\"\i}ve B cells.In conclusion, we demonstrate that LC-MBL is immunogenetically distinct from CLL. Major CLL BCR IG stereotypes are very scarce in individuals with or without LC-MBL. This could be taken to imply either that these stereotypes are indeed scarce in the blood of individuals unaffected by CLL or, alternatively, that they might reside within other B cell compartments not assessed in this study.Disclosures Agathangelidis: Gilead Sciences: Research Funding.

	abstract = {Mounting evidence supports the notion that T cells are crucial for the survival and expansion of the malignant clone in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Recently, NGS immunoprofiling of the T cell receptor (TR) gene repertoire in CLL revealed "disease-specific" TR clonotypes shared by different patients that persisted and further expanded over time, suggesting that antigen drive likely underlies T-cell expansions in CLL. CLL-like Monoclonal B-cell Lymphocytosis (MBL) is characterized by the presence of CLL-like clonal B cells in lower numbers compared to CLL with no other evidence of disease. MBL is distinguished into high and low count (HC-MBL and LC-MBL, respectively). HC-MBL may evolve to CLL requiring treatment and is considered a pre-leukemic condition, while LC-MBL has an unclear, if any, link to CLL, posing a particular conundrum, especially considering that despite sharing CLL-associated genomic aberrations it displays a distinct immunoglobulin gene repertoire. The precise mechanisms underlying MBL onset and/or progression into overt CLL remain unknown. Arguably, these could entail the acquisition of particular genetic lesions and/or extrinsic signals delivered to the clonal B cells, including those emanating from T cells. Considering the above, here we aimed at characterizing T cells in the early steps of CLL ontogeny by detailed immunoprofiling of the TR gene repertoire in LC-MBL, a thus far unexplored area.The study group comprised 43 individuals with CLL-like (CD5+) LC-MBL and 7 individuals with non CLL-like LC-MBL (atypical CLL-like and CD5- LC-MBL). The presence of a LC-MBL population was confirmed by a standardized flow cytometry protocol. TR beta chain (TRB) gene rearrangements were RT-PCR amplified with the use of the BIOMED 2 protocol. Sequencing libraries were prepared with the TruSeq DNA LT Kit and run on the MiSeq Sequencer using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (500 cycles). Raw NGS reads were subjected to data filtering based on read length and quality. Filtered-in sequences were submitted to IMGT/HighV-QUEST and an in-house bioinformatics pipeline for clonotype computation and repertoire characterization.Overall, 9,385,319 productive filtered-in TRBV-TRBD-TRBJ rearrangement sequences were evaluated corresponding to an average of 32,205 different (unique) clonotypes/sample (clonotype: same TRBV gene and CDR3 amino acid sequence). Skewing of the TRBV repertoire was identified in both LC-MBL categories. In specific, the 4/5 most frequently utilized TRBV genes were identical between the 2 categories (TRBV29-1, TRBV12-3, TRBV19, TRBV6-5) and cumulatively accounted for a virtually identical part of the respective repertoire (28.7\% versus 28.6\%). Comparison to our published data from CLL revealed similarities regarding TRBV gene usage, particularly for CLL-like LC-MBL. Oligoclonality was evident in both MBL categories with the 10 most frequent clonotypes accounting for 21.3\% of the total repertoire in CLL-like LC-MBL and 20.3\% in non CLL-like LC-MBL, again not differing significantly from CLL (26.3\%). All the above 3 entities were clearly more oligoclonal in comparison to 2 healthy control samples from aged-matched used as a reference. Cluster analysis among the 10 most frequent clonotypes of all LC-MBL and CLL samples revealed infrequent matches between: (i) different CLL-like LC-MBL samples (24/430, 0.055\%); (ii) CLL-like and non CLL-like LC-MBL (8/500, 0.016\%); and, (iii) CLL-like LC-MBL and CLL (2/680, 0.002\%).Altogether, these findings indicate that, similar to CLL, antigen drive likely underlies T-cell expansions also in LC-MBL. However, despite similar TRBV gene usage and degree of oligoclonality, scant shared clonotypes were identified, thus indicating that the antigenic stimuli and/or immune processes shaping the TR profiles in LC-MBL and CLL are distinct.Disclosures Agathangelidis: Gilead Sciences: Research Funding.

Several decades ago glucosinolate breakdown products were considered only as natural toxicants and used accordingly (e.g. as natural pesticides). However, the situation changed in 1992 after the identification and purification of sulforaphane (from glucoraphanin) exhibiting anticarcinogenic properties.

	abstract = {Despite the proved close connection of cervical cancer with the human papillomavirus (HPV), intensive ongoing research investigates the role of specific genetic and environmental factors in determining HPV persistence and subsequent progression of the disease. To this end, genetic association studies constitute a significant scientific approach that may lead to a more comprehensive insight on the origin of complex diseases. Nevertheless, association studies are most of the times inconclusive, since the datasets employed are small, usually incomplete and of poor quality. The main goal of ASSIST is to aid research in the field of cervical cancer providing larger high quality datasets, via a software system that virtually unifies multiple heterogeneous medical records, located in various sites. Furthermore, the system is being designed in a generic manner, with provision for future extensions to include other types of cancer or even different medical fields. Within the context of ASSIST, innovative techniques have been elaborated for the semantic modelling and fuzzy inferencing on medical knowledge aiming at meaningful data unification: (i) The ASSIST core ontology (being the first ontology ever modelling cervical cancer) permits semantically equivalent but differently coded data to be mapped to a common language. (ii) The ASSIST inference engine maps medical entities to syntactic values that are understood by legacy medical systems, supporting the processes of hypotheses testing and association studies, and at the same time calculating the severity index of each patient record. These modules constitute the ASSIST Core and are accompanied by two other important subsystems: (1) The Interfacing to Medical Archives subsystem maps the information contained in each legacy medical archive to corresponding entities as defined in the knowledge model of ASSIST. These patient data are generated by an advanced anonymisation tool also developed within the context of the project. (2) The User Interface enables transparent and advanced access to the data repositories incorporated in ASSIST by offering query expression as well as patient data and statistical results visualisation to the ASSIST end-users. We also have to point out that the system is easily extendable virtually to any medical domain, as the core ontology was designed with this in mind and all subsystems are ontology-aware i.e., adaptable to any ontology changes/additions. Using ASSIST, a medical researcher can have seamless access to medical records of participating sites and, through a particularly handy computing environment, collect data records satisfying his criteria. Moreover he can define cases and controls, select records adjusting their validity and use the most popular statistical tools for drawing conclusions. The logical unification of medical records of participating sites, including clinical and genetic data, to a common knowledge base is expected to increase the effectiveness of research in the field of cervical cancer as it permits the creation of on-demand study groups as well as the recycling of data used in previous studies.},

	abstract = {Protein classification is one of the most commonly discussed problems in bioinformatics. One of the latest tools for protein function annotation is the Gene Ontology (GO) project which provides a controlled vocabulary to describe gene and gene product attributes in organisms. Although there are several cases of automated annotation, the bulk of the annotation process is performed by human curators. We present a parrallel algorithm for GO term prediction, deployed over the EGEE grid environment. Gene ontology can be thought of as a database of expert-based terms. The application presented utilizes the motifs that exist in already annotated protein sequences in order to model the corresponding GO terms. The input data set is created in a semi-automatic way, using the unique (UNIPROT) code of each protein and the InterProScan tool so that all available sequence databases (such as PRODOM, PFAM etc) will be taken under consideration. For each GO term that appears in the original protein set, a new training set is created, which contains all the protein sequences that have been annotated with the specific GO term. Based on the motifs present in the new data sets, a finite state automaton model is created for each GO term. In order to predict the annotation of an unknown protein, its motif sequence is run through each GO model thus producing similarity scores for every term. Results have shown that the algorithm is both efficient and accurate in predicting the correct GO term. The methodology has been implemented so that it can be used both as a standalone or as a grid-based application. The algorithm however is by design an embarassingly parallel one allowing for multiple models to be trained simultaneously, thus making the Grid the ideal environment for execution. In fact, it has been shown experimentally that the time to process the entire dataset on a single processor is prohibitively long. In an MPI-enabled application the utilization of the clusters available over the Grid provides a significant reduction of the processing time. The Grid also enables the seamless integration of the training process with the actual model evaluation, by allowing the concurrent retraining of GO models from different input sources or experts and the use of the existing ones. The initial dataset is stored and replicated as a single compressed file on multiple storage elements (SEs). The application was executed on available clusters using from 4 to 32 processors in different experiment configurations. In all cases a significant speedup was observed, ranging from 300 to over 500. Overall, the utilization of the Grid as the application platform has provided both a reduction in processing time and a seamless environment for running simultaneously different experiments.},

	abstract = {An important challenge in modern functional proteomics is the prediction of the functional behavior of proteins. Motifs in protein chains can make such a prediction possible. The correlation between protein properties and their motifs is not always obvious, since more than one motifs can exist within a protein chain. Thus, the behavior of a protein is a function of many motifs, where some overpower others. In this paper a data-mining approach for motif-based classification of proteins is presented. A new classification rules inducing algorithm that exploits finite state automata is introduced. First, data are modeled by terms of prefix tree acceptors, which are later merged into finite state automata. Finally, we propose a new algorithm for the induction of protein classification rules from finite state automata. The data-mining model is trained and tested using various protein and protein class subsets, as well as the whole dataset of known proteins and protein classes. Results indicate the efficiency of our technique compared to other known data-mining algorithms.},
