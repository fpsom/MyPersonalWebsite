@phdthesis{FpsomPhDThesis,
	abstract = {Although Bioinformatics and Computational Biology are often confused as the same multidisciplinary field, there exist several differences that distinguish them. Bioinformatics focuses on analysis and processing of biological data and consequently the promotion of research in algorithms and technical level of both the methods and theory to solve formal problems of data management. On the other hand, Computational Biology aims to solve specific problems in Biology, utilizing the potential of computers for testing and evaluating hypothesis. Nevertheless the two fields share several areas of convergence. Proteomics is one of these areas and is also the focus of extensive ongoing research. Proteomics is essentially the large-scale study of proteins, ranging from the identification and analysis of their structure to the prediction of their functionality and the construction of metabolic pathways. In recent years there has been a shift in research interest in Bioinformatics from genomics to proteomics, which is widely considered as the next step in the study of biological systems. While the genome of an organization remains fairly constant in different cells of the same organization, the proteome of a species is highly differentiated from cell to cell. In previous years, genomics and proteomics could only focus on one gene or protein at a time. However, the technological advancements in Life Sciences has led to an exponentially growing amount of data. For this reason there has been a shift in research, from hypothesis-driven to data-driven studies. As the demand for automated analysis of large and distributed data grows, new challenges emerge both regarding the modeling and the development of algorithms for high throughput data analysis. This thesis presents a general methodology for Bioinformatics Algorithm Development in Grid Environments (BADGE) aiming at precisely these challenges. Grid Computing can be viewed as a virtual computing architecture that provides the ability to perform higher throughput processing by taking advantage of many computers geographically dispersed and connected by a network. Bioinformatics applications can benefit greatly from the increased availability, reliability and efficiency of computational resources, in such a distributed environment. There is already considerable research in progress toward applying parallel computing techniques on bioinformatics methods, such as multiple sequence alignment, gene expression analysis and phylogenetic studies. In order to cope with the dimensionality issue, most machine learning methods focus on specific groups of proteins or reduce either the size of the original data set or the number of attributes involved. Grid Computing can potentially provide an alternative solution to this problem, by combining multiple approaches in a seamless way. The BADGE methodology presented in this thesis, couples the strengths of the Grid with the specific needs and constraints of proven bioinformatics approaches. In order to evaluate the BADGE methodology, we applied it on several existing algorithms and on a series of new algorithms, which were developed to address issues both in Bioinformatics and in other research areas as well. The bioinformatics algorithms we designed mainly focus on proteomics and aim to provide solution to the problems of protein classification, prediction of protein function, and abnormal gene detection. Finally, the methodology was also used in the development of an algorithm in Computational Chemistry, addressing the problem of identifying molecular knots in three dimensional space. In every case, it was shown, both theoretically and experimentally, that the new approach presents clear advantages over conventional approaches in terms of time performance and robustness.},

@phdthesis{FpsomMasterThesis,
	abstract = {An important challenge in modern functional proteomics is the prediction of the functional behavior of proteins. Motifs in protein chains can make such a prediction possible. The correlation between protein properties and their motifs is not always obvious, since more than one motifs can exist within a protein chain. Thus, the behavior of a protein is a function of many motifs, where some overpower others. In this paper a data-mining approach for motif-based classification of proteins is presented. A new classification rules inducing algorithm that exploits finite state automata is introduced. First, data are modeled by terms of prefix tree acceptors, which are later merged into finite state automata. Finally, we propose a new algorithm for the induction of protein classification rules from finite state automata. The data-mining model is trained and tested using various protein and protein class subsets, as well as the whole dataset of known proteins and protein classes. Results indicate the efficiency of our technique compared to other known data-mining algorithms.},

   abstract = {As genome sequencing efforts are unveiling the genetic diversity of the biosphere with an unprecedented speed, there is a need to accurately describe the structural and functional properties of groups of extant species whose genomes have been sequenced, as well as their inferred ancestors, at any given taxonomic level of their phylogeny. Elaborate approaches for the reconstruction of ancestral states at the sequence level have been developed, subsequently augmented by methods based on gene content. While these approaches of sequence or gene-content reconstruction have been successfully deployed, there has been less progress on the explicit inference of functional properties of ancestral genomes, in terms of metabolic pathways and other cellular processes. Herein, we describe PathTrace, an efficient algorithm for parsimony-based reconstructions of the evolutionary history of individual metabolic pathways, pivotal representations of key functional modules of cellular function. The algorithm is implemented as a five-step process through which pathways are represented as fuzzy vectors, where each enzyme is associated with a taxonomic conservation value derived from the phylogenetic profile of its protein sequence. The method is evaluated with a selected benchmark set of pathways against collections of genome sequences from key data resources. By deploying a pangenome-driven approach for pathway sets, we demonstrate that the inferred patterns are largely insensitive to noise, as opposed to gene-content reconstruction methods. In addition, the resulting reconstructions are closely correlated with the evolutionary distance of the taxa under study, suggesting that a diligent selection of target pangenomes is essential for maintaining cohesiveness of the method and consistency of the inference, serving as an internal control for an arbitrary selection of queries. The PathTrace method is a first step towards the large-scale analysis of metabolic pathway evolution and our deeper understanding of functional relationships reflected in emerging pangenome collections.}

    abstract = {Author summary Everything we do today is becoming more and more reliant on the use of computers. The field of biology is no exception; but most biologists receive little or no formal preparation for the increasingly computational aspects of their discipline. In consequence, informal training courses are often needed to plug the gaps; and the demand for such training is growing worldwide. To meet this demand, some training programs are being expanded, and new ones are being developed. Key to both scenarios is the creation of new course materials. Rather than starting from scratch, however, it’s sometimes possible to repurpose materials that already exist. Yet finding suitable materials online can be difficult: They’re often widely scattered across the internet or hidden in their home institutions, with no systematic way to find them. This is a common problem for all digital objects. The scientific community has attempted to address this issue by developing a set of rules (which have been called the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable [FAIR] principles) to make such objects more findable and reusable. Here, we show how to apply these rules to help make training materials easier to find, (re)use, and adapt, for the benefit of all.},

These expansions are responsible for protein misfolding and self-assembly into intranuclear inclusion bodies (IIBs) that are somehow linked to neuronal death. However, owing to lack of a suitable cellular model, the downstream consequences of IIB formation are yet to be resolved. Here, we describe a nuclear protein aggregation model of pathogenic human ataxin-1 and characterize IIB effects. Using an inducible Sleeping Beauty transposon system, we overexpressed the ATXN1(Q82) gene in human mesenchymal stem cells that are resistant to the early cytotoxic effects caused by the expression of the mutant protein. We characterized the structure and the protein composition of insoluble polyQ IIBs which gradually occupy the nuclei and are responsible for the generation of reactive oxygen species. In response to their formation, our transcriptome analysis reveals a cerebellum-specific perturbed protein interaction network, primarily affecting protein synthesis. We propose that insoluble polyQ IIBs cause oxidative and nucleolar stress and affect the assembly of the ribosome by capturing or down-regulating essential components. The inducible cell system can be utilized to decipher the cellular consequences of polyQ protein aggregation. Our strategy provides a broadly applicable methodology for studying polyQ diseases.}

	abstract = {Scalable big data analysis frameworks are of paramount importance in the modern web society, which is characterized by a huge number of resources, including electronic text documents. Document clustering is an important field in text mining and is commonly used for document organization, browsing, summarization and classification. Hierarchical clustering methods construct a hierarchy structure that, combined with the produced clusters, can be useful in managing documents, thus making the browsing and navigation process easier and quicker, and providing only relevant information to the users’ queries by leveraging the structure relationships. Nevertheless, the high computational cost and memory usage of baseline hierarchical clustering algorithms render them inappropriate for the vast number of documents that must be handled daily. In this paper, we propose a new scalable hierarchical clustering framework, which uses the frequency of the topics in the documents to overcome these limitations. Our work consists of a binary tree construction algorithm that creates a hierarchy of the documents using three metrics (Identity, Entropy, Bin Similarity), and a branch breaking algorithm which composes the final clusters by applying thresholds to each branch of the tree. The clustering algorithm is followed by a meta-clustering module which makes use of graph theory to obtain insights in the leaf clusters’ connections. The feature vectors representing each document derive from topic modeling. At the implementation level, the clustering method has been dockerized in order to facilitate its deployment on cloud computing infrastructures. Finally, the proposed framework is evaluated on several datasets of varying size and content, achieving significant reduction in both memory consumption and computational time over existing hierarchical clustering algorithms. The experiments also include performance testing on cloud resources using different setups and the results are promising.}

Hence there is a distinct need to explore how the FAIR principles can be applied to software. In this work, we aim to summarize the current status of the debate around FAIR and software, as basis for the development of community-agreed principles for FAIR research software in the future. We discuss what makes software different from data with regard to the application of the FAIR principles, and which desired characteristics of research software go beyond FAIR. Then we present an analysis of where the existing principles can directly be applied to software, where they need to be adapted or reinterpreted, and where the definition of additional principles is required. Here interoperability has proven to be the most challenging principle, calling for particular attention in future discussions. Finally, we outline next steps on the way towards definite FAIR principles for research software.}

These resources include databases, software tools, training materials, cloud storage, and supercomputers. One of the goals of ELIXIR is to coordinate these resources so that they form a single infrastructure. This infrastructure makes it easier for scientists to find and share data, exchange expertise, and agree on best practices. ELIXIR's activities are divided into the following five areas: Data, Tools, Interoperability, Compute and Training, each known as “platform”. The ELIXIR Tools Platform works to improve the discovery, quality and sustainability of software resources. The Software Development Best Practices task of the Tools Platform aims to raise the quality and sustainability of research software by producing, adopting, and promoting information standards and best practices relevant to the software development life cycle. We have published four (4OSS) simple recommendations to encourage best practices in research software (Jiménez et al. 2017) and the Top 10 metrics for recommended life science software practices (Artaza et al. 2016).
  The 4OSS simple recommendations are as follows: (1) Develop a publicly accessible open source code from day one, (2) Make software easy to discover by providing software metadata via a popular community registry, (3) Adopt a license and comply with the licenses of third-party dependencies, and (4) Have clear and transparent contribution, governance and communication processes. In order to encourage researchers and developers to adopt the 4OSS recommendations and build FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) software, the best practices group, in partnership with the ELIXIR Training platform, The Carpentries (Carpentries 2019, ELIXIR Europe 2019b), and other communities, are creating a collection of training materials (Kuzak et al. 2019). The next step is to adopt, promote, and recognise these information standards and best practices. The group will address this by (i) developing comprehensive guidelines for software curation, (ii) through training researchers and developers towards the adoption of software best practices and (iii) improvement of the usability of Tools Platform products. Additionally, a direct outcome of this task will be a software management plan template, connected to a concise description of the guidelines for open research software; and production of a white paper for the software development management plan for ELIXIR, which can be consequently used to produce training materials. We will work with the newly formed ReSA (Research Software Alliance) to facilitate the adoption of this plan for the broader community.},

The relative concentrations of some VOCs such as 1-octen-3-ol, trans-2-octenal, trans,trans-2,4-heptadienal, 2-butanone, 3-butanone, 2-heptanone, ethyl isobutyrate, ethyl acetate, ethyl-2-methylbutyrate, ethyl isovalerate, hexanoic acid ethyl ester and indole, exhibited an increasing trend during crab storage, making them promising spoilage markers. The composition of microbial communities at different storage temperatures was examined by 16S amplicon meta-barcoding analysis. This kind of analysis in conjugation with the volatile profile can be used to explore the microbiological quality and further assist towards the application of the appropriate strategies to extend crab shelf-life and protect consumer's health.},

	abstract = {Any computational process from simple data analytics tasks to training a machine learning model can be described by a workflow. Many workflow management systems (WMS) exist that undertake the task of scheduling workflows across distributed computational resources. In this work, we introduce a WMS that leverages machine learning to predict workflow task runtime and the probability of failure of task assignments to execution sites. The expected runtime of workflow tasks can be used to approximate the weight of the workflow graph branches in respect to the total workflow workload and the ability to anticipate task failures can discourage task assignments that are unlikely to succeed. We demonstrate that the proposed machine learning models can lead to significantly more informed scheduling decisions that minimize task failures and utilize execution sites more efficiently, thus leading to reduced workflow runtime. Additionally, we train a modified sequence-to-sequence neural network architecture via reinforcement learning to perform scheduling decisions as part of a WMS. Our approach introduces a WMS that can drastically improve its scheduling performance by independently learning over time, without external intervention or reliance on any specific heuristic or optimization technique. Finally, we test our approach in real-world scenarios utilizing computationally demanding and data intensive workflows and evaluate its performance against existing scheduling methodologies traditionally used in WMSes. The performance evaluation outcome confirms that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the other scheduling algorithms in a consistent manner and achieves the best execution runtime with the lowest number of failed tasks and communication costs.},

	abstract = {Comprehensive analysis of the clonotypic B cell receptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG) gene rearrangement sequences in patients with mature B cell neoplasms has led to the identification of significant repertoire restrictions, culminating in the discovery of subsets of patients expressing highly similar, stereotyped BcR IG. This finding strongly supports selection by common epitopes or classes of structurally similar epitopes in the ontogeny of these tumors. BcR IG stereotypy was initially described in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where the stereotyped fraction of the disease accounts for a remarkable one-third of patients. However, subsequent studies showed that stereotyped BcR IG are also present in other neoplasms of mature B cells, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL). Subsequent cross-entity comparisons led to the conclusion that stereotyped IG are mostly ``disease-specific,'' implicating distinct immunopathogenetic processes. Interestingly, mounting evidence suggests that a molecular subclassification of lymphomas based on BcR IG stereotypy is biologically and clinically relevant. Indeed, particularly in CLL, patients assigned to the same subset due to expressing a particular stereotyped BcR IG display remarkably consistent biological background and clinical course, at least for major and well-studied subsets. Thus, the robust assignment to stereotyped subsets may assist in the identification of mechanisms underlying disease onset and progression, while also refining risk stratification. In this book chapter, we provide an overview of the recent BcR IG stereotypy studies in mature B cell malignancies and outline previous and current methodological approaches used for the identification of stereotyped IG.},

This study attempts to investigate data users’ requirements and the role that data repositories can play in supporting data discoverability by meeting those requirements. We collected 79 data discovery use cases (or data search scenarios), from which we derived nine functional requirements for data repositories through qualitative analysis. We then applied usability heuristic evaluation and expert review methods to identify best practices that data repositories can implement to meet each functional requirement. We propose the following ten recommendations for data repository operators to consider for improving data discoverability and user’s data search experience: 1. Provide a range of query interfaces to accommodate various data search behaviours. 2. Provide multiple access points to find data. 3. Make it easier for researchers to judge relevance, accessibility and reusability of a data collection from a search summary. 4. Make individual metadata records readable and analysable. 5. Enable sharing and downloading of bibliographic references. 6. Expose data usage statistics. 7. Strive for consistency with other repositories. 8. Identify and aggregate metadata records that describe the same data object. 9. Make metadata records easily indexed and searchable by major web search engines. 10. Follow API search standards and community adopted vocabularies for interoperability.}

	abstract = {Introduction: Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) is a potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In light of encouraging results by complement inhibition treatment, a few studies and case series have reported complement-related genetic variants in patients with TA-TMA. However, several issues remain undisclosed, regarding both the incidence of such variants and the clinical importance of pre-transplant genetic profiling. Within this context, we hypothesized that pre-transplant genetic susceptibility is evident in adult TA-TMA patients but not in their donors or control transplanted patients and also investigated the association of genetic variants with response to treatment and survival.Methods:To this end, we enrolled consecutive adult allogeneic HCT recipients diagnosed with TA-TMA according to the International Working Group criteria between 2014-2017. Patients were managed based on institutional policy with conventional treatment including withdrawal of calcineurin or mTOR inhibitors, steroid administration and/or plasma infusion/plasma exchange. To test our hypothesis, we also studied donors of the enrolled patients with available samples and age- and sex-matched control HCT recipients. Genomic DNA was extracted from pre-transplant peripheral blood samples of TA-TMA patients, donors and controls. Probes were designed using the Design studio (Illumina). The amplicons cover the exonic regions of complement regulatory genes (complement factor H/CFH, CFH-related, CFI, CFB, CFD, C3, CD55, C5, CD46, thombomodulin/THBD) and TMA-associated ADAMTS13, spanning 15 bases into the intronic regions. After quality assessment, each sample was treated independently in order to produce the appropriate mapping of the reads against the human reference genome hg19. Variant calling was performed using the Genome Annotation Toolkit and variant annotation using annovar together with supplemental databases. Variants with minor allele frequency lower than 1\% were considered rare.Results:We studied 30 patients that presented TA-TMA at median + 73 (9-540) days with full hematopoietic constitution, 18 donors of our patients and 30 controls, without significant differences in transplant characteristics (Table).Donors of patients presented significantly lower number of detected (p=0.039) and rare (p=0.049) variants per sample, as well as variants in exonic, splicing or UTR regions (p=0.025) compared to TA-TMA patients. In control patients, we also observed a significantly lower number of rare variants in ADAMTS13 (p=0.002), CD46 (p=0.001), CFH (p=0.010), CFI (p=0.031) and CFB (p=0.016) compared to TA-TMA patients (Graph). Variants previously reported to be pathogenic in TMAs were found in ADAMTS13 and CFB. While heterozygous pathogenic mutations were present in both TA-TMA and control samples, homozygous pathogenic mutations were evident only in 4 TA-TMA patients (p=0.038).Regarding clinical outcomes, 21 of 30 TA-TMA patients (70\%) were refractory to conventional treatment. Refractory patients presented a significantly increased incidence of variants in exonic, splicing or UTR regions (p=0.045) compared to responders. 12 patients received eculizumab based on institutional policy. Despite initial laboratory response to eculizumab treatment, only 4 of 12 survived. 19 out of 30 patients succumbed to treatment-related mortality, which was also associated with significantly increased number of variants in exonic, splicing or UTR regions (p=0.012).Conclusions:Increased incidence of pathogenic, rare and exonic variants in TA-TMA patients supports a relevant role for genetic susceptibility that is not evident in control HCT recipients or patients{\textquoteright} donors. This, combined with the finding that exonic variants were associated with refractoriness to treatment and increased mortality, indicates that pre-transplant genetic profiling may be useful to intensify monitoring and early intervention in high-risk patients. In this complex setting, the functional and clinical role of genetic variants needs to be further investigated in prospective studies.Disclosures Gavriilaki: European Hematology Association: Research Funding.

	abstract = {Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), we recently documented the clonal architecture of the T cell repertoire in treatment-naive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), with ample immunogenetic evidence indicating selection by restricted antigens. Our preliminary NGS study in 16 patients pre- and 3-month post-treatment indicated a differential impact of standard chemoimmunotherapy (FCR) versus B cell receptor signaling inhibitors (BcRi) on CLL T cells. Prompted by these observations, here we sought to comprehensively assess CLL T cell repertoire changes over treatment in relation to both treatment type and clinical response by combining NGS immunoprofiling, flow cytometry and functional assays.NGS profiling of the T cell receptor (TR) gene repertoire was performed in 28 CLL patients who received FCR (n=9), ibrutinib (IB, n=15) and/or rituximab-idelalisib (R-ID, n=10) at successive timepoints (pre, +3mo, +9mo and at deepest clinical response, total samples: n=113). TRBV-TRBD-TRBJ gene rearrangements were RT-PCR amplified and subjected to paired-end NGS. Raw reads were processed through a purpose-built, validated bioinformatics pipeline, culminating to 20,347,768 productive, filtered-in TRB sequences (median 155,479/sample). For repertoire analysis, clonotypes (i.e. rearrangements with identical TRBV gene usage and amino acid complementarity-determining region 3 sequence) were considered (median 11,420 distinct clonotypes/sample).All cases displayed significant clonal T cell expansions both pre- and post-treatment [median clonality, measured as the cumulative frequency of the 10 most expanded (major) clonotypes/sample: 30.3\% and 39.6\%, respectively]. Median clonality significantly increased at +3mo in the FCR (29.0\% to 46.9\%, p\&lt;.001) and R-ID group (33.0\% to 39.1\%, p\&lt;.001), but not in the IB group (33.3\% to 31.2\%, p\&gt;.05). Overtime analysis revealed a gradual increase of clonality over deepening clinical response (pre-, +3mo, +9mo, deepest response) in the R-ID group (33.0\% to 39.1\% to 46.0\% to 46.1\%, respectively; p\&lt;.001), but only a trend in this respect for IB (33.3\% to 31.2\% to 33.8\% to 42.0\%; p\&gt;.05). Considering that FCR resulted in T cell repertoire reconstitution whereas BcRis retained pre-treatment clones, we then focused on major clones persisting over treatment and found that they significantly expanded in the R-ID group, peaking at +3mo (p\&lt;.01). Cross-comparison across all CLL patients and against 767,438 unique TRB sequences retrieved from multiple public databases (HSV infections, T-cell lymphoproliferations, autoimmune disorders, healthy individuals), revealed 23/563 major clonotypes shared exclusively among CLL patients, alluding to selection by conserved CLL-related antigens. We then sought to test the functional effect of treatments on T cells. To this end, we evaluated activation markers on CLL T cell subpopulations for 8 CLL patients (R-ID, n=4; IB, n=4) pre- and +3mo post-treatment by flow cytometry and found statistically significant upregulation of T cell activation markers for R-ID compared to IB, particularly for: (i) CD69 in CD4+ effector memory T cells (p\&lt;.01); (ii) CD25 in CD8+ TEMRA T cells (p=0.006); and, (iii) CD38 in CD8+ effector memory T cells (p\&lt;.05) and CD8+ TEMRA T cells (p\&lt;.05). We also investigated the ability of CD3+ T cells, purified from 13 patients pre- and +3mo post-treatment (FCR, n=3; R-ID, n=5; IB, n=5), to form immune synapses with autologous pre-treatment CD19+ tumor cells. Quantitative relative recruitment index (RRI) analysis for F-actin showed that both R-ID (p\&lt;.01) and IB (p\&lt;.05) treated T cells form polarized immune synapses in contrast to FCR (p\&gt;.05).Taken together, NGS immunoprofiling suggests that BcRis retain T cell clones that may have developed in response to CLL-related antigens, which in the case of R-ID expand and peak at +3mo. Phenotypic and immune synapse bioassays support a concurrent restoration of functionality, mostly evident for R-ID, arguably contributing to clinical response. Overall, this data provides rationale for designing combination strategies, e.g. of R-ID with immunomodulating drugs, aiming to boost cytotoxic anti-tumor responses. Moreover, identifying the relevant neoepitopes may eventually pave the way for stratified treatments by means of engineered T cells or peptide vaccines, especially if these epitopes are conserved among CLL.Disclosures Vardi: Janssen: Honoraria; Gilead: Research Funding.

	abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) stereotyped subsets \#6 and \#8 include cases expressing unmutated B cell receptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG) (U-CLL). Subset \#6 (IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20) is less aggressive compared to subset \#8 (IGHV4-39/IGKV1(D)-39) which has the highest risk for Richter's transformation among all CLL. The underlying reasons for this divergent clinical behavior are not fully elucidated. To gain insight into this issue, here we focused on epigenomic signatures and their links with gene expression, particularly investigating genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in subsets \#6 and \#8 as well as other U-CLL cases not expressing stereotyped BcR IG. We found that subset \#8 showed a distinctive DNA methylation profile compared to all other U-CLL cases, including subset \#6. Integrated analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression revealed significant correlation for several genes, particularly highlighting a relevant role for the TP63 gene which was hypomethylated and overexpressed in subset \#8. This observation was validated by quantitative PCR, which also revealed TP63 mRNA overexpression in additional non-subset U-CLL cases. BcR stimulation had distinct effects on p63 protein expression, particularly leading to induction in subset \#8, accompanied by increased CLL cell survival. This pro-survival effect was also supported by siRNA-mediated downregulation of p63 expression resulting in increased apoptosis. In conclusion, we report that DNA methylation profiles may vary even among CLL patients with similar somatic hypermutation status, supporting a compartmentalized approach to dissecting CLL biology. Furthermore, we highlight p63 as a novel prosurvival factor in CLL, thus identifying another piece of the complex puzzle of clinical aggressiveness. This article is protected by copyright.

Recently, our group reported the generation of pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) transcriptome databases from two contrasting cultivars with extreme fruit sizes. In the current study we used these databases to perform comparative transcriptome analysis in order to identify genes with potential roles in fruit morphology and fruit size. Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis between cv. ‘Munchkin’ (small-fruit) and cv. ‘Big Moose’ (large-fruit) revealed a variety of candidate genes associated with fruit morphology with significant differences in gene expression between the two cultivars. In addition, we have set the framework for generating EST-SSR markers, which discriminate different C. pepo cultivars and show transferability to related Cucurbitaceae species. The results of the present study will contribute to both further understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating fruit morphology and furthermore identifying the factors that determine fruit size. Moreover, they may lead to the development of molecular marker tools for selecting genotypes with desired morphological traits.}

Thus not only exchange of some task-dependent modules is required, but also supervisory responsibilities have to be switched. Such control systems are necessary in the case of robot companions, where the owner of the robot may demand from it to provide many services.}

The proposed RAPP framework has been designed aiming towards a cloud-based integrated approach that enables robotic devices to seamlessly deploy robotic applications, relieving the actual robots from computational burdens. The Robotic Applications (RApps) developed according to the RAPP paradigm will empower consumer social robots, allowing them to adapt to versatile situations and materialize complex behaviors and scenarios.

In order to provide efficient solutions, the community is turning towards scalable approaches such as the utilization of cloud resources in addition to any existing local computational infrastructures. Although bioinformatics workflows are generally amenable to parallelization, the challenges involved are however not only computationally, but also data intensive. In this paper we propose a data management methodology for achieving parallelism in bioinformatics workflows, while simultaneously minimizing data-interdependent file transfers. We combine our methodology with a novel two-stage scheduling approach capable of performing load estimation and balancing across and within heterogeneous distributed computational resources. Beyond an exhaustive experimentation regime to validate the scalability and speed-up of our approach, we compare it against a state-of-the-art high performance computing framework and showcase its time and cost advantages.},

A new approach in alleviating the social exclusion of older people involves the use of assistive robots. As robots rapidly invade everyday life, the need of new software paradigms in order to address the user's unique needs becomes critical.

	abstract = {Phylogenetic profiles express the presence or absence of genes and their homologs across a number of reference genomes. They have emerged as an elegant representation framework for comparative genomics and have been used for the genome-wide inference and discovery of functionally linked genes or metabolic pathways. As the number of reference genomes grows, there is an acute need for faster and more accurate methods for phylogenetic profile analysis with increased performance in speed and quality. We propose a novel, efficient method for the detection of genomic idiosyncrasies, i.e. sets of genes found in a specific genome with peculiar phylogenetic properties, such as intra-genome correlations or inter-genome relationships. Our algorithm is a four-step process where genome profiles are first defined as fuzzy vectors, then discretized to binary vectors, followed by a de-noising step, and finally a comparison step to generate intra- and inter-genome distances for each gene profile. The method is validated with a carefully selected benchmark set of five reference genomes, using a range of approaches regarding similarity metrics and pre-processing stages for noise reduction. We demonstrate that the fuzzy profile method consistently identifies the actual phylogenetic relationship and origin of the genes under consideration for the majority of the cases, while the detected outliers are found to be particular genes with peculiar phylogenetic patterns. The proposed method provides a time-efficient and highly scalable approach for phylogenetic stratification, with the detected groups of genes being either similar to their own genome profile or different from it, thus revealing atypical evolutionary histories.},

Over 2,000 protein families are detected across multiple species, with a distribution consistent to other studied pangenomes. Of these, there are 180 protein families with multiple members, 312 families with exactly 37 members corresponding to core genes, 428 families with peripheral genes with varying taxonomic distribution and finally 1,125 smaller families. The fact that, even for smaller genomes of Chlamydiales, core genes represent over a quarter of the average protein complement, signifies a certain degree of structural stability, given the wide range of phylogenetic relationships within the group. In addition, the propagation of a corpus of manually curated annotations within the discovered core families reveals key functional properties, reflecting a coherent repertoire of cellular capabilities for Chlamydiales. We further investigate over 2,000 genes without homologs in the pangenome and discover two new protein sequence domains. Our results, supported by the genome-based phylogeny for this group, are fully consistent with previous analyses and current knowledge, and point to future research directions towards a better understanding of the structural and functional properties of Chlamydiales.},

Bioinformatics applications stand to gain in such a distributed environment in terms of increased availability, reliability and efficiency of computational resources. There is already considerable research in progress toward applying parallel computing techniques on bioinformatics methods, such as multiple sequence alignment, gene expression analysis and phylogenetic studies. In order to cope with the dimensionality issue, most machine learning methods either focus on specific groups of proteins or reduce the size of the original data set and/or the number of attributes involved. Grid computing could potentially provide an alternative solution to this problem, by combining multiple approaches in a seamless way. In this paper we introduce a unifying methodology coupling the strengths of the Grid with the specific needs and constraints of the major bioinformatics approaches.

    abstract = {Classification of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) based on the immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene somatic hypermutation (SHM) status has established predictive and prognostic relevance. The SHM status is assessed based on the number of mutations within the sequence of the rearranged IGHV gene excluding the VH CDR3. This is mostly due to the difficulty in discriminating actual SHM from random nucleotides added between the recombined IGHV, IGHD and IGHJ genes. Hence, this approach may underestimate the true impact of SHM, in fact overlooking the most critical region for antigen-antibody interactions i.e. the VH CDR3. Relevant to mention in this respect, studies from our group in CLL with mutated IGHV genes (M-CLL), particularly subset #4, have revealed considerable intra-VH CDR3 diversity attributed to ongoing SHM.Prompted by these findings, here we investigated whether SHM may also be present in cases bearing 'truly unmutated' IGHV genes (i.e. 100\\% germline identity across VH FR1-VH FR3), focusing on two well characterized stereotyped subsets i.e. subset #1 (IGHV clan I/IGHD6-19/IGHJ4) and subset #6 (IGHV1-69/IGHD3-16/IGHJ3). These subsets carry germline-encoded amino acid (aa) motifs within the VH CDR3, namely QWL and YDYVWGSY, originating from the IGHD6-19 and IGHD3-16 gene, respectively. However, in both subsets, cases exist with variations in these motifs that could potentially represent SHM.The present study included 12 subset #1 and 5 subset #6 patients with clonotypic IGHV genes lacking any SHM (100\\% germline identity). IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ gene rearrangements were RT-PCR amplified by subgroup-specific leader primers and a high-fidelity polymerase in order to ensure high data quality. RT-PCR products were subjected to paired-end NGS on the MiSeq platform. Sequence annotation was performed with IMGT/HighV-QUEST and metadata analysis was undertaken using an in-house purpose-built bioinformatics pipeline. Rearrangements with the same IGHV gene and identical VH CDR3 aa sequences were defined as clonotypes.Overall, we obtained 1,570,668 productive reads with V-region identity 99-100\\%; of these, 1,232,958 (mean: 102,746, range: 20,796-242,519) concerned subset #1 while 337,710 (mean: 67,542, range: 50,403-79,683) concerned subset #6. On average, 64.4\\% (range: 1.7-77.5\\%) of subset #1 reads and 49.2\\% (range: 0.7-70\\%) of subset #6 reads corresponded to rearrangements with IGHV genes lacking any SHM (100\\% germline identity). Clonotype computation revealed 1,831 and 1,048 unique clonotypes for subset #1 and #6, respectively. Subset #1 displayed a mean of 157 distinct clonotypes per sample (range: 74-267), with the dominant clonotype having a mean frequency of 96.9\\% (range: 96-98.2\\%). Of note, 44 clonotypes were shared between different patients (albeit at varying frequencies), including the dominant clonotype of 11/12 cases, which was present in 2-6 additional subset #1 patients. Subset #6 cases carried a higher number of distinct clonotypes per sample (mean: 219, range: 189-243) while the dominant clonotype had a mean frequency of 95.6\\% (range: 94.5-96.5\\%). Shared clonotypes (n=30) were identified also in subset #6 and the dominant clonotype of each subset #6 case was present in 3-5 additional subset #6 patients. Focusing on the VH CDR3, in particular the IGHD-encoded part, the following observations were made: (1) in both subsets, extensive intra-VH CDR3 variation was detected at certain positions within the IGHD gene; (2) in most cases, the observed aa substitutions were conservative i.e. concerned aa sharing similar physicochemical properties. Particularly noteworthy in this respect were the observations in subset #6 that: (i) the valine residue (V) in the D-derived YDYVWGSY motif was very frequently mutated to another aliphatic residue (A, I, L); (ii) in cases were the predominant clonotype carried I (also in the Sanger-derived sequence), several minor clonotypes carried the germline-encoded V, compelling evidence that the observed substitution concerned true SHM.In conclusion, we provide immunogenetic evidence for intra-VH CDR3 variations, very likely attributed to SHM, in CLL patients carrying 'truly unmutated' IGHV genes. While the prognostic/predictive relevance of this observation is beyond the scope of the present work, our findings highlight the possible need to reappraise definitions ('semantics') regarding SHM status in CLL.Stamatopoulos:Janssen: Honoraria, Research Funding; Abbvie: Honoraria, Research Funding.

    abstract = {Calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D, modulates a plethora of cellular processes following its receptor ligation, namely the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a nuclear transcription factor that regulates the transcription of diverse genes. It has been proposed that vitamin D may play a role in prevention and treatment of cancer while epidemiological studies have linked vitamin D insufficiency to adverse disease outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Recently, we reported that VDR is functional in CLL cells after calcitriol supplementation, as well as after stimulation through both the calcitriol/VDR signaling system and other prosurvival pathways triggered from the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we aimed at investigating key molecules and signaling pathways that are altered after calcitriol treatment and are known to play a relevant role in CLL pathophysiology.CD19+ primary CLL cells were negatively selected from peripheral blood samples of patients that were treatment naïve at the time of sample collection. CLL cells were cultured in vitro with calcitriol or co-cultured with the HS-5 mesenchymal cell line for 24 hours. VDR+, CYP24A1+, phospho-ERK+ and phospho-NF-κB p65+ cells were determined by Flow Cytometry (FC). Total RNA was extracted from calcitriol-treated and non-treated CLL cells, while mRNA selection was performed using NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module. Library preparation for RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis was conducted with the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit. The libraries were paired-end sequenced on the NextSeq 500 Illumina platform. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2; genes with log2FC\\&gt;|1| and P≤0.05 were considered as differentially expressed.RNA-Seq analysis (n=6) confirmed our previous findings that the CYP24A1 gene is significantly upregulated by calcitriol, being the top upregulated gene, whereas the VDR gene remains unaffected by this treatment. Overall, 85 genes were differentially expressed in unstimulated versus calcitriol-treated cells, of which 28 were overexpressed in the latter thus contrasting the remaining 57 which showed the opposite pattern. Pathway enrichment and gene ontology (GO) analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed significant enrichment in PI3K-Akt pathway and Toll-like receptor cascades, as well as in vitamin D metabolism and inflammatory response pathways. Additionally, flow cytometric analysis showed that calcitriol-treated CLL cells displayed increased pERKlevels (FD=1.3, p\\&lt;0.05) and, in contrast decreased pNF-κBlevels (FD=2.7, p\\&lt;0.05), highlighting active VDR signaling in CLL. Aiming at placing our findings in a more physiological context, we co-cultured CLL cells with the HS-5 cell line. Based on our previous finding that co-cultured CLL cells showed induced CYP24A1 levels, we evaluated pNF-κB expression. pNF-κB levels were found to be increased in co-cultured CLL cells (FD=4.2, p\\&lt;0.05), while the addition of calcitriol downregulated pNF-κB (FD=1.5, p\\&lt;0.05). Moreover, ex vivo calcitriol exposure of CLL cells from patients under ibrutinib treatment (at baseline, +1 and +3-6 months, n=7) resulted in significant upregulation of pERK (FD=1.6, p\\&lt;0.01; FD=1.4, p\\&lt;0.01; FD=1.9, p\\&lt;0.01; for each timepoint respectively) but, significant downregulation of pNF-κΒ (FD=3.4, p\\&lt;0.01; FD=3, p\\&lt;0.05; FD=2.3, p\\&lt;0.05; for each timepoint respectively), indicating preserved calcitriol/VDR signaling capacity.In conclusion, we provide evidence that the calcitriol/VDR system is active in CLL, modulating NF-κB and MAPK signaling as well as the expression of the CYP24A1 target gene. This observation is further supported by RNA-Seq analysis that confirms CYP24A1 upregulation and highlights new signaling pathways that need to be validated. Interestingly, the calcitriol/VDR system appears relatively unaffected by either stimulation or inhibition (ibrutinib) of microenvironmental signals that promote CLL cell survival and/or proliferation, indicating context-independent signaling capacity.Kotsianidis:Celgene: Research Funding.

    abstract = {Stereotyped subset #2 (IGHV3-21/IGLV3-21) is the largest subset in CLL (~3\\% of all patients). Membership in subset #2 is clinically relevant since these patients experience an aggressive disease irrespective of the somatic hypermutation (SHM) status of the clonotypic immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene. Low-throughput evidence suggests that stereotyped subset #169, a minor CLL subset (~0.2\\% of all CLL), resembles subset #2 at the immunogenetic level. More specifically: (i) the clonotypic heavy chain (HC) of subset #169 is encoded by the IGHV3-48 gene which is closely related to the IGHV3-21 gene; (ii) both subsets carry VH CDR3s comprising 9-amino acids (aa) with a conserved aspartic acid (D) at VH CDR3 position 3; (iii) both subsets bear light chains (LC) encoded by the IGLV3-21 gene with a restricted VL CDR3; and, (iv) both subsets have borderline SHM status. Here we comprehensively assessed the ontogenetic relationship between CLL subsets #2 and #169 by analyzing their immunogenetic signatures. Utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS) we studied the HC and LC gene rearrangements of 6 subset #169 patients and 20 subset #2 cases. In brief, IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ and IGLV-IGLJ gene rearrangements were RT-PCR amplified using subgroup-specific leader primers as well as IGHJ and IGLC primers, respectively. Libraries were sequenced on the MiSeq Illumina instrument. IG sequence annotation was performed with IMGT/HighV-QUEST and metadata analysis conducted using an in-house, validated bioinformatics pipeline. Rearrangements with identical CDR3 aa sequences were herein defined as clonotypes, whereas clonotypes with different aa substitutions within the V-domain were defined as subclones. For the HC analysis of subset #169, we obtained 894,849 productive sequences (mean: 127,836, range: 87,509-208,019). On average, each analyzed sample carried 54 clonotypes (range: 44-68); the dominant clonotype had a mean frequency of 99.1\\% (range: 98.8-99.2\\%) and displayed considerable intraclonal heterogeneity with a mean of 2,641 subclones/sample (range: 1,566-6,533). For the LCs of subset #169, we obtained 2,096,728 productive sequences (mean: 299,533, range: 186,637-389,258). LCs carried a higher number of distinct clonotypes/sample compared to their partner HCs (mean: 148, range: 110-205); the dominant clonotype had a mean frequency of 98.1\\% (range: 97.2-98.6\\%). Intraclonal heterogeneity was also observed in the LCs, with a mean of 6,325 subclones/sample (range: 4,651-11,444), hence more pronounced than in their partner HCs. Viewing each of the cumulative VH and VL CDR3 sequence datasets as a single entity branching through diversification enabled the identification of common sequences. In particular, 2 VH clonotypes were present in 3/6 cases, while a single VL clonotype was present in all 6 cases, albeit at varying frequencies; interestingly, this VL CDR3 sequence was also detected in all subset #2 cases, underscoring the molecular similarities between the two subsets. Focusing on SHM, the following observations were made: (i) the frequent 3-nucleotide (AGT) deletion evidenced in the VH CDR2 of subset #2 (leading to the deletion of one of 5 consecutive serine residues) was also detected in all subset #169 cases at subclonal level (average: 6\\% per sample, range: 0.1-10.8\\%); of note, the 5-serine stretch is also present in the germline VH CDR2 of the IGHV3-48 gene; (ii) the R-to-G substitution at the VL-CL linker, a ubiquitous SHM in subset #2 and previously reported as critical for IG self-association leading to cell autonomous signaling in this subset, was present in all subset #169 samples as a clonal event with a mean frequency of 98.3\\%; and, finally, (iii) the S-to-G substitution at position 6 of the VL CDR3, present in all subset #2 cases (mean : 44.2\\% ,range: 6.3-87\\%), was also found in all #169 samples, representing a clonal event in 1 case (97.2\\% of all clonotypes) and a subclonal event in the remaining 5 cases (mean: 0.6\\%, range: 0.4-1.1\\%). In conclusion, the present high-throughput sequencing data cements the immunogenetic relatedness of CLL stereotyped subsets #2 and #169, further highlighting the role of antigen selection throughout their natural history. These findings also argue for a similar pathophysiology for these subsets that could also be reflected in a similar clonal behavior, with implications for risk stratification.Sutton:Abbvie: Honoraria; Gilead: Honoraria; Janssen: Honoraria.

    abstract = {In CLL, subsets of patients carrying stereotyped B cell receptors (BcR) share similar biological and clinical features independently of IGHV gene somatic hypermutation status. Although the chromatin landscape of CLL as a whole has been recently characterized, it remains largely unexplored in stereotyped cases. Here, we analyzed the active chromatin regulatory landscape of 3 major CLL stereotyped subsets associated with clinical aggressiveness.We performed chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) with an antibody for the H3K27ac histone mark in sorted CLL cells from 19 cases, including clinically aggressive subsets #1 (clan I genes/IGKV(D)1-39, IG-unmutated CLL (U-CLL)(n=3)], #2 [IGHV3-21/IGLV3-21, IG-mutated CLL (M-CLL)(n=3)] and #8 [IGHV4-39/IGKV1(D)-39, U-CLL(n=3)] which we compared to non-stereotyped CLL cases [5 M-CLL|5 U-CLL]. In addition, a series of 15 normal B cell samples from different stages of B-cell differentiation were analyzed [naive B cells from peripheral blood (n=3), tonsillar naive B cells (n=3), germinal centre (GC) B cells (n=3), memory B cells (n=3), tonsillar plasma cells (n=3)].Initial unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) disclosed a distinct chromatin acetylation pattern in CLL, regardless of stereotypy status, versus normal B cells. CLL as a whole was found to be closer to naive and memory B cells rather than GC B cells and plasma cells. Detailed analysis of individual principal components (PC) revealed that PC4, which accounts for 5\\% of the total variability, segregated subset #8 cases and GC B cells from other CLLs and normal B cell subpopulations. Although PC4 accounts for only a small part of the total variability (5\\%), this suggests that subset #8 cases may share some chromatin features with proliferating GC B cells, in line with the fact that subset #8 BcR are IgG-switched.We also investigated whether stereotyped CLLs have different chromatin acetylation features compared to non-stereotyped CLLs matched by IGHV somatic hypermutation status and identified 878 Differential Regions (DR) in subset #8 vs. U-CLL, 84 DR in subset #1 vs. U-CLL and 66 DR in #2 compared vs. M-CLL.As subset #8 cases seemed to have the most distinct profile, we further characterized the detected regions. The 435 and 443 regions gaining and losing activation, respectively, mostly targeted promoters (29.5\\%) and regulatory elements located in introns (31\\%) and distal intergenic regions (21.8\\%). Hierarchical clustering based on the 878 DRs enabled the clear discrimination of subset #8 cases from U-CLL and normal B cells; however, it is worth noting that for several of these 878 DRs the acetylation patterns were shared between subset #8 and normal B cell subpopulations rather than subset #8 and U-CLL.Of note, 11/435 regions gaining activity on subset #8 were found within the gene encoding for the EBF1 transcription factor (TF); additional regions were associated with genes significant to CLL pathogenesis, e.g. TCF4 and E2F1. Moreover, 3 DRs losing activity in subset #8 were located within the CTLA4 gene and 2 DRs within the IL21R gene, which we have recently reported as hypermethylated and not expressed in subset #8.Next, we performed TF binding site analysis by MEME/AME suit, separately for regions gaining or losing activity, and identified significant enrichment (adj-p\\&lt;0.001) on TFs such as AP-1, FOX, GATA, IRF. The regions losing activity in subset #8 showed a higher number of enriched TFs versus those gaining activity (165 vs 93 TFs), particularly displaying enrichment for many HOX family members . However, a cluster of TFs with enrichment on TF binding site analysis, such as FOXO1, FOXP1, MEF2D, PRDM1, RUNX1, RXRA, STAT6, were also located within the 878 DRs discriminating subset #8 from either U-CLL or normal B cell subpopulations.Taken together, subset #8 cases have a distinct chromatin acetylation signature which includes both loss and gain of active elements, shared features with proliferating GC B cells, and specific changes in chromatin activity of several genes and TFs relevant to B cell/CLL biology. These findings further underscore the concept that BcR stereotypy defines subsets of patients with consistent biological profile, while they may also be relevant to the particular clinical behavior of subset #8, known to be associated with the highest risk of Richter's transformation amongst all CLL.Stamatopoulos:Abbvie: Honoraria, Research Funding; Janssen: Honoraria, Research Funding.},

	abstract = {In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the existence of subsets of patients with stereotyped B cell receptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG), collectively accounting for ~30\% of all CLL, strongly implicates antigen selection in disease ontogeny. That said, it is still inconclusive if and how frequently "CLL-specific" BcR IG gene rearrangements occur in the repertoire of unaffected individuals. This is especially relevant when also considering monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), detected in 3-12\% of the general population and characterized by the presence of CLL-like clonal B cells in lower numbers compared to CLL with no evidence of disease. MBL is distinguished into high and low count (HC-MBL and LC-MBL, respectively) with the former considered as a pre-leukemic condition, while the latter having an unclear, if any, link to CLL. Our previous immunogenetic studies have revealed similarities between HC-MBL and CLL, thus setting them apart from LC-MBL that displayed distinct IG gene usage and low incidence of stereotypy. However, these studies were Sanger-based, thus inherently limited regarding sensitivity and accurate quantification.Here we sought to overcome these limitations and obtain a comprehensive view into the composition of the IG repertoire in LC-MBL by NGS immunoprofiling, searching particularly for major CLL IG stereotypes. The study group comprised 23 individuals with CLL-like (CD5+) LC-MBL identified by a standardized flow cytometry protocol. PBMCs were the starting material in 11 cases, whereas sorted MBL cells were studied in the remaining 12 cases; in 9 cases, the normal B cell compartment was also flow sorted. Included in the analysis were also 6 individuals without LC-MBL in whom we sorted different B cell subpopulations, including na{\"\i}ve B cells (n=6) and memory B cells (n=5). IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ gene rearrangements were RT-PCR amplified with leader primers and sequencing libraries were prepared with the TruSeq DNA LT Kit and run on the MiSeq Sequencer using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3. NGS reads were subjected to an in-house bioinformatics pipeline for clonotype characterization and the identification of CLL-specific BcR IG stereotypes.Overall, 16,857,788 productive filtered-in sequence reads were obtained corresponding to an average of 366,474 reads/sample (range: 67,175-662,994). We identified very few reads (2,470/16,857,788; 0.15\%) corresponding to 17/19 major CLL BcR IG stereotypes. Their incidence in LC-MBL did not follow the CLL trend: for instance, the stereotypic IGHV3-21 gene rearrangement defining subset $\#$2, the most frequent in CLL, accounted for only 27/2,470 reads (1.1\%) corresponding to major subset stereotypes. Overall, stereotypes were identified in 26/47 samples (55\%) from 13/23 LC-MBL and 6/6 non LC-MBL cases. In LC-MBL cases bearing stereotypes the breakdown according to sample type was as follows: (i) PBMCs, n=3 (ii) normal B cell compartment, n=7; (iii) sorted MBL cells, n=5: the stereotypes detected in this particular sample type were present at very low frequencies and concerned rearrangements with unmutated IGHV genes. In individuals without LC-MBL, stereotypes were detected in all 6 samples from na{\"\i}ve B cells versus only 2/5 samples from memory B cells. In general, we did not identify significant associations between specific B cell subpopulations and particular stereotypes, except for the IGHV4-34 rearrangement defining CLL subset $\#$4, an indolent CLL variant with features of BcR-anergized clones, which was found only within na{\"\i}ve B cells.In conclusion, we demonstrate that LC-MBL is immunogenetically distinct from CLL. Major CLL BCR IG stereotypes are very scarce in individuals with or without LC-MBL. This could be taken to imply either that these stereotypes are indeed scarce in the blood of individuals unaffected by CLL or, alternatively, that they might reside within other B cell compartments not assessed in this study.Disclosures Agathangelidis: Gilead Sciences: Research Funding.

	abstract = {Mounting evidence supports the notion that T cells are crucial for the survival and expansion of the malignant clone in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Recently, NGS immunoprofiling of the T cell receptor (TR) gene repertoire in CLL revealed "disease-specific" TR clonotypes shared by different patients that persisted and further expanded over time, suggesting that antigen drive likely underlies T-cell expansions in CLL. CLL-like Monoclonal B-cell Lymphocytosis (MBL) is characterized by the presence of CLL-like clonal B cells in lower numbers compared to CLL with no other evidence of disease. MBL is distinguished into high and low count (HC-MBL and LC-MBL, respectively). HC-MBL may evolve to CLL requiring treatment and is considered a pre-leukemic condition, while LC-MBL has an unclear, if any, link to CLL, posing a particular conundrum, especially considering that despite sharing CLL-associated genomic aberrations it displays a distinct immunoglobulin gene repertoire. The precise mechanisms underlying MBL onset and/or progression into overt CLL remain unknown. Arguably, these could entail the acquisition of particular genetic lesions and/or extrinsic signals delivered to the clonal B cells, including those emanating from T cells. Considering the above, here we aimed at characterizing T cells in the early steps of CLL ontogeny by detailed immunoprofiling of the TR gene repertoire in LC-MBL, a thus far unexplored area.The study group comprised 43 individuals with CLL-like (CD5+) LC-MBL and 7 individuals with non CLL-like LC-MBL (atypical CLL-like and CD5- LC-MBL). The presence of a LC-MBL population was confirmed by a standardized flow cytometry protocol. TR beta chain (TRB) gene rearrangements were RT-PCR amplified with the use of the BIOMED 2 protocol. Sequencing libraries were prepared with the TruSeq DNA LT Kit and run on the MiSeq Sequencer using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (500 cycles). Raw NGS reads were subjected to data filtering based on read length and quality. Filtered-in sequences were submitted to IMGT/HighV-QUEST and an in-house bioinformatics pipeline for clonotype computation and repertoire characterization.Overall, 9,385,319 productive filtered-in TRBV-TRBD-TRBJ rearrangement sequences were evaluated corresponding to an average of 32,205 different (unique) clonotypes/sample (clonotype: same TRBV gene and CDR3 amino acid sequence). Skewing of the TRBV repertoire was identified in both LC-MBL categories. In specific, the 4/5 most frequently utilized TRBV genes were identical between the 2 categories (TRBV29-1, TRBV12-3, TRBV19, TRBV6-5) and cumulatively accounted for a virtually identical part of the respective repertoire (28.7\% versus 28.6\%). Comparison to our published data from CLL revealed similarities regarding TRBV gene usage, particularly for CLL-like LC-MBL. Oligoclonality was evident in both MBL categories with the 10 most frequent clonotypes accounting for 21.3\% of the total repertoire in CLL-like LC-MBL and 20.3\% in non CLL-like LC-MBL, again not differing significantly from CLL (26.3\%). All the above 3 entities were clearly more oligoclonal in comparison to 2 healthy control samples from aged-matched used as a reference. Cluster analysis among the 10 most frequent clonotypes of all LC-MBL and CLL samples revealed infrequent matches between: (i) different CLL-like LC-MBL samples (24/430, 0.055\%); (ii) CLL-like and non CLL-like LC-MBL (8/500, 0.016\%); and, (iii) CLL-like LC-MBL and CLL (2/680, 0.002\%).Altogether, these findings indicate that, similar to CLL, antigen drive likely underlies T-cell expansions also in LC-MBL. However, despite similar TRBV gene usage and degree of oligoclonality, scant shared clonotypes were identified, thus indicating that the antigenic stimuli and/or immune processes shaping the TR profiles in LC-MBL and CLL are distinct.Disclosures Agathangelidis: Gilead Sciences: Research Funding.

Several decades ago glucosinolate breakdown products were considered only as natural toxicants and used accordingly (e.g. as natural pesticides). However, the situation changed in 1992 after the identification and purification of sulforaphane (from glucoraphanin) exhibiting anticarcinogenic properties.

Bioinformatics applications stand to gain in such a distributed environment in terms of availability, reliability and efficiency of computational resources. There is already considerable research in progress toward applying parallel computing techniques on bioinformatics methods, such as multiple sequence alignment, gene expression analysis and phylogenetic studies. In order to cope with the dimensionality issue, most machine learning methods focus on specific groups of proteins or reduce either the size of the original data set or the number of attributes involved. Grid computing could potentially provide an alternative solution to this problem, by combining multiple approaches in a seamless way. In this paper we introduce a unifying methodology coupling the strengths of the Grid with the specific needs and constraints of the major bioinformatics approaches.

	abstract = {Despite the proved close connection of cervical cancer with the human papillomavirus (HPV), intensive ongoing research investigates the role of specific genetic and environmental factors in determining HPV persistence and subsequent progression of the disease. To this end, genetic association studies constitute a significant scientific approach that may lead to a more comprehensive insight on the origin of complex diseases. Nevertheless, association studies are most of the times inconclusive, since the datasets employed are small, usually incomplete and of poor quality. The main goal of ASSIST is to aid research in the field of cervical cancer providing larger high quality datasets, via a software system that virtually unifies multiple heterogeneous medical records, located in various sites. Furthermore, the system is being designed in a generic manner, with provision for future extensions to include other types of cancer or even different medical fields. Within the context of ASSIST, innovative techniques have been elaborated for the semantic modelling and fuzzy inferencing on medical knowledge aiming at meaningful data unification: (i) The ASSIST core ontology (being the first ontology ever modelling cervical cancer) permits semantically equivalent but differently coded data to be mapped to a common language. (ii) The ASSIST inference engine maps medical entities to syntactic values that are understood by legacy medical systems, supporting the processes of hypotheses testing and association studies, and at the same time calculating the severity index of each patient record. These modules constitute the ASSIST Core and are accompanied by two other important subsystems: (1) The Interfacing to Medical Archives subsystem maps the information contained in each legacy medical archive to corresponding entities as defined in the knowledge model of ASSIST. These patient data are generated by an advanced anonymisation tool also developed within the context of the project. (2) The User Interface enables transparent and advanced access to the data repositories incorporated in ASSIST by offering query expression as well as patient data and statistical results visualisation to the ASSIST end-users. We also have to point out that the system is easily extendable virtually to any medical domain, as the core ontology was designed with this in mind and all subsystems are ontology-aware i.e., adaptable to any ontology changes/additions. Using ASSIST, a medical researcher can have seamless access to medical records of participating sites and, through a particularly handy computing environment, collect data records satisfying his criteria. Moreover he can define cases and controls, select records adjusting their validity and use the most popular statistical tools for drawing conclusions. The logical unification of medical records of participating sites, including clinical and genetic data, to a common knowledge base is expected to increase the effectiveness of research in the field of cervical cancer as it permits the creation of on-demand study groups as well as the recycling of data used in previous studies.},

	abstract = {Protein classification is one of the most commonly discussed problems in bioinformatics. One of the latest tools for protein function annotation is the Gene Ontology (GO) project which provides a controlled vocabulary to describe gene and gene product attributes in organisms. Although there are several cases of automated annotation, the bulk of the annotation process is performed by human curators. We present a parrallel algorithm for GO term prediction, deployed over the EGEE grid environment. Gene ontology can be thought of as a database of expert-based terms. The application presented utilizes the motifs that exist in already annotated protein sequences in order to model the corresponding GO terms. The input data set is created in a semi-automatic way, using the unique (UNIPROT) code of each protein and the InterProScan tool so that all available sequence databases (such as PRODOM, PFAM etc) will be taken under consideration. For each GO term that appears in the original protein set, a new training set is created, which contains all the protein sequences that have been annotated with the specific GO term. Based on the motifs present in the new data sets, a finite state automaton model is created for each GO term. In order to predict the annotation of an unknown protein, its motif sequence is run through each GO model thus producing similarity scores for every term. Results have shown that the algorithm is both efficient and accurate in predicting the correct GO term. The methodology has been implemented so that it can be used both as a standalone or as a grid-based application. The algorithm however is by design an embarassingly parallel one allowing for multiple models to be trained simultaneously, thus making the Grid the ideal environment for execution. In fact, it has been shown experimentally that the time to process the entire dataset on a single processor is prohibitively long. In an MPI-enabled application the utilization of the clusters available over the Grid provides a significant reduction of the processing time. The Grid also enables the seamless integration of the training process with the actual model evaluation, by allowing the concurrent retraining of GO models from different input sources or experts and the use of the existing ones. The initial dataset is stored and replicated as a single compressed file on multiple storage elements (SEs). The application was executed on available clusters using from 4 to 32 processors in different experiment configurations. In all cases a significant speedup was observed, ranging from 300 to over 500. Overall, the utilization of the Grid as the application platform has provided both a reduction in processing time and a seamless environment for running simultaneously different experiments.},

	abstract = {Advances in biomedical engineering have lately facilitated medical data acquisition, leading to increased availability of both genetic and phenotypic patient. Particularly, in the area of cervical cancer intensive research investigates the role of specific genetic and environmental factors in determining the persistence of the HPV virus – which is the primary causal factor of cervical cancer – and the subsequent progression of the disease. To this direction, genetic association studies constitute a widely used scientific approach for medical research. However, despite the increased data availability worldwide, individual studies are often inconclusive due to the physical and conceptual isolation of the medical centers that limit the pool of data actually available to each researcher. ASSIST, an EU-funded research project, aims at facilitating medical research on cervical cancer by tackling these data isolation issues. To accomplish that, it virtually unifies multiple patient record repositories, physically located at different sites and subsequently employs inferencing techniques on the unified medical knowledge to enable the execution of cervical cancer related association studies that comprise both genotypic and phenotypic study factors, allowing medical researchers to perform more complex and reliable association studies on larger, high-quality datasets.},

In this paper a new framework for MD simulations is presented, which utilizes software agents. Every agent in our multi-agent system corresponds to a single particle and probes its environment for candidate agent-particles with which an interaction is possible. The framework is applied on protein structural data (PDB files) using an implicit solvent environment and a time step of 5 femtoseconds.

Due to the complexity of this correlation most data mining algorithms are either non efficient or time consuming. In this paper a data mining methodology that utilizes grid technologies is presented. First, data are split into multiple sets while preserving the original data distribution in each set. Then, multiple models are created by using the data sets as independent training sets.
